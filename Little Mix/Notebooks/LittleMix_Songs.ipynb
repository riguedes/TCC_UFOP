        "\n",
        "Little Mix foi um *girl group* britânico formado pela seguintes integrantes: Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock e Perrie Edwards. Descritas como o maior grupo feminino da última década, o grupo foi formado em 2011 durante a oitava temporada do *The X Factor* ganhando proeminência ao se tornarem o primeiro e único grupo feminino a ganharem o programa. Em sua formação original a banda era composta por quatro integrantes até que em dezembro de 2020, Jesy Nelson afirma estar deixando a banda. Elas são bastante conhecidas por suas fortes harmonias, por simbolizar o empoderamento feminino além de falarem abertamente sobre imagem corporal, suas experiências com o machismo na indústria, direitos LGBTQ+ e racismo.\n",
        "\n",
        "Durante a carreira a banda se estabeleceu como o grupo feminino de mais sucesso da década de 2010, e de acordo com a *Billboard*, o grupo acumulou uma estimativa de mais de 75 milhōes de discos e singles vendidos ao redor do mundo fazendo delas o grupo feminino britânico que mais vendeu à nível global atrás apenas das Spice Girls. Apenas no Reino Unido, o quarteto vendeu uma estimativa de 28 milhões de singles e 4.5 milhões de álbuns tornando-se o ato feminino britânico na história do país que mais vendeu *singles* com base em certificados oficiais. A banda tornou-se a única *girl group* a conseguir permanecer por 100 semanas no top dez nas paradas da *UK Singles Charts*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Little Mix é um dos atos femininos mais bem sucedidos na cultura popular britânica contemporânea e são constantemente aclamadas por serem um dos melhores grupos femininos de todos os tempos.
