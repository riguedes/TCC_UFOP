    "Fifth Harmony foi um girl group estadunidense, formado na segunda temporada do reality show The X Factor USA. O grupo era formado por Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Lauren Jauregui e Dinah Jane. A formação original incluía Camila Cabello, que anunciou sua saída oficialmente em dezembro de 2016. Elas lançaram um EP e três álbuns completos. O grupo até hoje vendeu mais de 15 milhões de discos e singles apenas nos Estados Unidos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seus prêmios incluem quatro iHeartRadio Music Awards, três MTV Europe Music Awards, cinco MTV Video Music Awards, um American Music Award, um Billboard Women in Music Award e nove Teen Choice Awards. Em dezembro de 2016, somente nos Estados Unidos, Fifth Harmony tinha vendido um total de 424 mil álbuns, sete milhões de músicas digitais e 1,6 bilhões de download digital, de acordo com a Nielsen Soundscan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originalmente, o nome do grupo era \"LYLAS\", mas já existia outra banda chamada \"The Lylas\". Assim, LYLAS mudou seu nome para 1432 na qual os jurados Simon Cowell e L.A. Reid criticaram o novo nome e Cowell sugeriu que mudassem o nome novamente. Cowell decidiu seguir com elas, mas anunciou que abriria uma votação online para escolher um novo nome para o girl group. O nome escolhido pelo público foi \"Fifth Harmony\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Cerca de um mês depois de terminar a segunda temporada de X Factor, em 14 de janeiro de 2013, Fifth Harmony foi eleita a \"Próxima Superestrela Pop de 2013\" pela revista Popdust. Elas passaram a fazer covers e receberam elogios dos artistas originais, entre eles Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande e Mikky Ekko.\n",
